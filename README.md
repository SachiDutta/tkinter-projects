# tkinter-projects

(This repo is basically a collection of some of my tkinter projects)

They are as follows ->
## 1. cdt2: countdown timer 
  > we can set our time in hour:minute:second format after which a 1 second alarm sound plays to refer that the time is up.
## 2. imcm: Image compressor 
  > A short tkinter practice project to compress the image size (although the quality degrades too).
## 3. passgen: password generator 
  > we can generate our password between the length of 4-12 consisting of alphabets(lowercase & uppercase) , numerical values, punctuations. 
## 4. ytvdown: Youtube video downloader
  > not everyone has premium for youtube ,so here is one another tkinter prac project to download youtube videos by just copying and pasting the url in the program.
## 5. calculator
  > a very basic calculator using tkinter
## 6. drawboard
  > a basic drawing board
